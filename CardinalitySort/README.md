* Given an array of positive numbers, sort the array in ascending order of count of set of bits in binary representation.

- Return those numbers in the sorted cardinality way.

Example:
- Input: $arr[] = {5, 31, 15, 7, 3, 2 };
- Output: 2 3 7 15 31

- Explanation:
The integers in their binary representation are:
- number  / bit
- 31    / 11111
- 15    / . 1111
- 7  / .  0111
- 3  / .  0011
- 2  / .  0010
