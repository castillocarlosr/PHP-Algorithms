* Given an array of positive numbers, sort the array in ascending order of count of set of bits in binary representation.

- Return those numbers in the sorted cardinality way.

Example:
- Input: $arr[] = {5, 31, 15, 7, 3, 2 };
- Output: 2 3 7 15 31

- Explanation:
The integers in their binary representation are:
- number&nbsp; &nbsp; bit
- 31&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11111
- 15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1111
- 7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0111
- 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0011
- 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0010
