#### Code Challenges

*  This is me breaking into PHP.
- I get asked technical questions in different languages I hardly touch.
- So this is me practicing in the languages I hardly use.
- Expect JAVA, Python, and Ruby to follow, as I get asked these questions as well.

- Note:  I mostly code in C# and JavaScript.
